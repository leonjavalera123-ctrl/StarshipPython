handoff.py  --  lets the 3D ship game ask this game to run ONE level.
====================================================================

Read this if you're wondering how two separate games talk to each other.

THE PROBLEM
    The 3D ship (built in Godot) can't run Python. So when you walk up to a
    console aboard the Pyxis and press E, the ship launches THIS game as a
    separate program. But it needs to say two things:

        "run level 3, please"   ... and later ...   "so, how did it go?"

THE SOLUTION -- two one-way messages, both dead simple:

    1) The ship ASKS by passing command-line arguments when it starts us:

           python main.py --level 3 --session abc123 --report C:/tmp/r.json

       `read_request()` below reads those. If there are none (you just
       double-clicked the game normally), it returns None and NOTHING changes --
       the game boots to its usual title screen.

    2) We ANSWER by writing a small JSON file at the path we were given.
       `write_report()` below does that. The ship reads it and certifies the
       system.

WHY COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS AND NOT A SHARED FILE?
    A leftover "please run level 3" file would silently hijack the game the next
    time you opened it normally. Arguments vanish when the program closes, so
    they can never go stale.

WHY THE SESSION ID?
    So an OLD report file can never be mistaken for this run. The ship makes up
    an id, we echo it back, and the ship ignores any report that doesn't match.

This file imports nothing from the rest of the game, so it can never break it.

    CLEAN means: the level was finished, and the hint ladder was never walked
    all the way down to its last rung.

    HINTS ARE FREE ON PURPOSE. A nervous beginner should be able to lean on
    hints as much as they like and still earn full marks -- what we're actually
    measuring is "did you get there yourself", and a nudge in the right
    direction still counts as getting there. Only reading the FULL ANSWER (the
    final rung of the ladder, which simply prints the solution) means the task
    didn't teach you anything.

    IMPORTANT: clean is a COSMETIC label. Certification -- which unlocks decks,
    destinations and doors -- only ever needs `cleared`. A cadet who leans on
    every hint in the game still certifies the whole ship.

    Anything missing or malformed grades as NOT clean. That matters: if a
    session crashes before it can report, we must never award a better result
    than the cadet earned.
